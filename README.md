# oldghrepos
My old GitHub repos when I was 11-12.
There's not really much here.
Contents:
- Hello.html
- idiot-github-io
- Mayo-Python
- notepad
- OldGmailUI
- OldRandomVirus
- ProgrammingGizmos
- WindowsAntivirus
- Yuchubu-no-u-ebusaito
- 
There are much more, but these are the only ones that are both complete and (mostly) have a function.
